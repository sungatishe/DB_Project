    <h1 id="Astr">Astronaut</h1>
    <p id="Astr2"> An <b>Astronaut</b>  is a person who tests and operates space technology in space flight.
      The concept of space flight in different countries is different. According to the classification 
      of the International Federation of Aeronautics (FAI), a flight is considered to be space flight, the 
      height of which exceeds 100 km. According to the classification of the US Air Force, a flight in space 
      is considered to be a flight whose altitude exceeds 50 miles (80 km 467 m). In Russia, space flight is 
      called orbital flight, that is, a flight in which the device must make at least one revolution around the Earth. 
      That is why the total number of astronauts in different sources varies.

            from Engels. April 12, 1961, the day of Yuri Gagarin's flight into space, was declared a holiday - 
            Cosmonautics Day. On March 27, 1968, Yuri Gagarin died in a plane crash near the village of Novoselovo,

               <h1>International space</h1>
               <p>Until the end of the 1970s, only two countries - the USSR and the USA - had cosmonauts. In 1976, the
                 Interkosmos program was launched in the Soviet Union, within the framework of which the first group, 
                 consisting of 6 cosmonauts from socialist countries, began training. In 1978, a second group was added 
                 to it. Around the same time, ESA selected 4 people who began training for the first flight of the 
                 Spacelab program aboard the Space Shuttle. In 1980, France independently began its own selection of 
                 astronauts, followed by Germany in 1982, Canada in 1983, Japan in 1985, and Italy in 1988.</p>
